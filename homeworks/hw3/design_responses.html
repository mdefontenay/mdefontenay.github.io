					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>How important just creating a typo guideline is important. Commonly, we are tempted to just straight start coding with a specific font, without thinking of the global structure of website. Sometimes it can lead in inconsistances. Creating a typo like this could save us from this.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>When the guy recommended websites for font and actually showed example. As for me, design is the apogee of the sentece "<i>Don't Show, Tell</i>", when he actually shows us how examples it's when we want the most to try.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p><i>Typography is all about experimentation. </i>(I won't go as far as saying it's an art but I agree that it is by experimenting that we find the perfect font)</p>
						</li>
