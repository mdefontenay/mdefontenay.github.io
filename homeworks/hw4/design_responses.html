					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Sometimes I am scared of using color as it can be a bit too much. This article explains well how t use colors in a resonable way. It also warns us on its use, and clarify how accessibility can rellay a lot on the color palet we choose.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>The intro, as he introduces well the subject. He directly talks about the main points, and it's a greate condensation of what he is gonna teach us. Also, he has a very serious tone during the whole article, it's the only time he feels more accessible..</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"<i>Not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude</i>" (it's like the main quote but I find it really pertinent and funny :) ) </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
