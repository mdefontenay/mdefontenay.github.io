    <h4><em>Astrophysics/Physics Major | 1st year</em></h4>
    <p>
      Hello... My name is Matthieu, I'm a freshman intending to major in physics
      / astro, I'm French,<br />
      and I like designing things. I wanted to take this DeCal as a series of
      bad desicions led me to take way<br />
      too hard classes in one semester so I wanted to have a fun class that
      could teach me coding in other<br />
      languages :) I like going to the movies, whatching Netflix or YouTube, and
      I am passionated about Astronomy.

    <ul>
      <li>To be honest, design has always been something that interested me. Every
        time I start using an app, or going on a website, I like to decript it. The 
        information the article gave are still very interesting :)</li>
      <li>I like how it really break appart every step of "obervation". It's always 
        interesting to see how brands like<br />
        twitter or youtube are obtimizing their interface.</li>
      <li>When I started off in design, I sucked.</li>
      <li>I would say a 8/10</li>
    </ul>
