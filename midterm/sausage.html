      <div id="title">Sausage? Hot Dog? top dog™!</div>
      <br />
      A SAUSAGE IS – any chopped or ground meat or vegetable matter that has
      been seasoned and formed into a tube. Except for our skinless veggie
      “wienies”, all top dog™ traditional sausages are encased in a natural
      membrane and usually follow tradition-tested recipes with textures ranging
      from a coarse chop to a fine emulsion. Most are smoke-cured using only
      natural hardwoods and may be made fresh, cooked, semi-dry or dry, though
      most of the fifty million-plus eaten daily in the U.S. are of the cooked
      variety and then reheated.
      <br /><br />
      Long before refrigeration, meat was salted to preserve it. In fact, the
      word “sausage” derives from Latin “salsus” denoting salted or preserved.
      Dating back to 2,500 B.C. , the first written reference was found in
      Salamis, appropriately enough. Two thousand years later the ancient Greeks
      and Romans had made sausages a happy part of their diet, flavoring them
      with garlic and cooking them in wine. Even Aborigines in Australia make a
      sausage they bury and can retrieve to eat months later. Now that’s staying
      power – no hamburger, pizza or fried chicken there.
      <br /><br />
      AND A HOT DOG IS – any one of the world’s many different kinds of sausages
      that has been heated and served in bread, usually a bun. Not hot? Brr,
      that’s a cold dog…
      <br /><br />
      By 1700 the hot dog – in form – had become popular in Germany and by 1850
      in the Eastern U.S. as well, thanks to its many German immigrants. Within
      another fifty years “wiener” (from Vienna/Wien), then “wienie” and also
      “frankfurter” were, and still are names used to mean “hot dog” even though
      these very similar sausages were probably “Brühwürsts” (sausages cooked to
      broth) from Halberstadt in eastern Germany where they were just part of
      the hot dog-to-be – minus the bun.
      <br /><br />
      Not until around 1905 did T.A. (“Tad”) Dorgan, a well-known sports
      cartoonist in New York City, introduce the phrase “hot dog” with a drawing
      of a dachshund (the long and low German dog) in a bun. This was his way of
      illustrating the actual sausages now in buns being sold at the New York
      Giants baseball team at their Polo Grounds home stadium – and that he
      couldn’t spell “dachshund” … (Note: before sausages made it into buns they
      had even been sold at Coney Island with gloves as to prevent
      finger-burning!)
      <br /><br />
      BUT top dog™ IS – well, special. And not just that we’ve been selling fine
      hot dogs in Berkeley, Oakland and elsewhere around The Bay since 1966.
      Rather, that its originator was introduced by his German immigrant parents
      to traditional top-quality European-style sausages when only a boy in New
      York before World War II. Then also there were the many excellent
      kosher-style frankfurters in hot dogs at pushcarts, stands and restaurants
      everywhere. Hot dog heaven! Truth to tell, that boy grew up preferring a
      good “tubesteak” to an ordinary steak. And still does. That love of, that
      reverence for a top hot dog became top dog™, only by then the scene was
      San Francisco Bay and the tradition of just a typical skinless frankfurter
      or wiener sausage in a hot dog sandwich was forever altered. top dog™
      became the first to offer hot dog fans a choice among a significant
      variety of quality sausages including the best eastern kosher-style
      all-beef frankfurter in a memorable bun, our top dog. Onward!
