        Sausage? Hot Dog? top dog™!
        <br><br>
            A SAUSAGE IS – any chopped or ground meat or vegetable matter that has been 
        seasoned and formed into a tube. Except for our skinless veggie “wienies”, all top dog™ 
        traditional sausages are encased in a natural membrane and usually follow 
        tradition-tested recipes with textures ranging from a coarse chop to a fine emulsion. 
        Most are smoke-cured using only natural hardwoods and may be made fresh, cooked, 
        semi-dry or dry, though most of the fifty million-plus eaten daily in the U.S. are of 
        the cooked variety and then reheated.
        <br><br>
            Long before refrigeration, meat was salted to preserve it. In fact, the word 
        “sausage” derives from Latin “salsus” denoting salted or preserved. Dating back to 2,500 
        B.C. , the first written reference was found in Salamis, appropriately enough. Two 
        thousand years later the ancient Greeks and Romans had made sausages a happy part of 
        their diet, flavoring them with garlic and cooking them in wine. Even Aborigines in 
        Australia make a sausage they bury and can retrieve to eat months later. Now that’s 
        staying power – no hamburger, pizza or fried chicken there.
        <br><br>
            AND A HOT DOG IS – any one of the world’s many different kinds of sausages that 
        has been heated and served in bread, usually a bun. Not hot? Brr, that’s a cold dog…
        <br><br>
            By 1700 the hot dog – in form – had become popular in Germany and by 1850 in the 
        Eastern U.S. as well, thanks to its many German immigrants. Within another fifty years 
        “wiener” (from Vienna/Wien), then “wienie” and also “frankfurter” were, and still are 
        names used to mean “hot dog” even though these very similar sausages were probably 
        “Brühwürsts” (sausages cooked to broth) from Halberstadt in eastern Germany where they 
        were just part of the hot dog-to-be – minus the bun.
        <br><br>
            Not until around 1905 did T.A. (“Tad”) Dorgan, a well-known sports cartoonist in 
        New York City, introduce the phrase “hot dog” with a drawing of a dachshund (the long 
        and low German dog) in a bun. This was his way of illustrating the actual sausages 
        now in buns being sold at the New York Giants baseball team at their Polo Grounds 
        home stadium – and that he couldn’t spell “dachshund” … (Note: before sausages made 
        it into buns they had even been sold at Coney Island with gloves as to prevent 
        finger-burning!)
        <br><br>
            BUT top dog™ IS – well, special. And not just that we’ve been selling fine hot 
        dogs in Berkeley, Oakland and elsewhere around The Bay since 1966. Rather, that its 
        originator was introduced by his German immigrant parents to traditional top-quality 
        European-style sausages when only a boy in New York before World War II. Then also 
        there were the many excellent kosher-style frankfurters in hot dogs at pushcarts, 
        stands and restaurants everywhere. Hot dog heaven! Truth to tell, that boy grew up 
        preferring a good “tubesteak” to an ordinary steak. And still does. That love of, 
        that reverence for a top hot dog became top dog™, only by then the scene was San 
        Francisco Bay and the tradition of just a typical skinless frankfurter or wiener 
        sausage in a hot dog sandwich was forever altered. top dog™ became the first to offer 
        hot dog fans a choice among a significant variety of quality sausages including the 
        best eastern kosher-style all-beef frankfurter in a memorable bun, our top dog. 
        Onward!
