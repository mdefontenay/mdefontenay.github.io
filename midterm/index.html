        <b>Top Dog</b> grew out of a boy's love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants' 
        New York home over the WWII years. Steaks? Tubesteaks! His paper route to a 
        well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages 
        were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far 
        to go to a cart or stand offering kosher style "Franks", usually steeped but 
        better off the griddle.
